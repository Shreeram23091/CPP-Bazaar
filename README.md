### N-Queens Problem

#### Overview
The N-Queens problem is a classical problem in computer science and mathematics, where the task is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

#### Solution Approach
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The program recursively places queens on the chessboard and backtracks when it encounters conflicts, ensuring that all possible solutions are explored.

#### Usage
To use the program:
1. Compile the `nqueens.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable and enter the size of the chessboard (N).
3. The program will output all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem for the given board size.

#### Example
For N = 4, one of the possible solutions is:
```
0 1 0 0 
0 0 0 1 
1 0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 
```

### All Permutations Problem

#### Overview
The All Permutations problem involves generating all possible permutations of a given string. A permutation of a string is an arrangement of its characters in a specific order.

#### Solution Approach
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the All Permutations problem using a recursive approach. The program generates all possible permutations of the input string by recursively swapping characters.

#### Usage
To use the program:
1. Compile the `all_permutations.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable and enter the input string.
3. The program will output all possible permutations of the input string.

#### Example
For input string "abc", the program will output:
```
abc
acb
bac
bca
cab
cba
```

### Phone Keypad Problem

#### Overview
The Phone Keypad problem involves generating all possible combinations of letters corresponding to a given sequence of numbers on a phone keypad.

#### Solution Approach
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Phone Keypad problem using a recursive approach. The program generates all possible combinations of letters by recursively exploring the mappings of digits to letters on a phone keypad.

#### Usage
To use the program:
1. Compile the `phone_keypad.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable and enter the input sequence of numbers.
3. The program will output all possible combinations of letters corresponding to the input sequence.

#### Example
For input sequence "23", the program will output:
```
ad
ae
af
bd
be
bf
cd
ce
cf
```

## Rat in a Maze Problem

### Overview
The Rat in a Maze problem involves finding all possible paths for a rat to move from the starting cell to the destination cell in a maze.

### Solution Approach
This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Rat in a Maze problem using a backtracking algorithm.

### Usage
To use the program:
1. Compile the `rat_maze.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
